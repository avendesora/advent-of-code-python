# advent-of-code-2021

My Python solutions for the 2021 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) puzzles.

I focused more on getting to the solution as quickly (in developer time) as possible rather than going for the most elegant solution. (Though, hopefully, the solutions are still decently readable and performant.)
